/*!
 @brief Discover any unpaired devices and allow the user to choose one to connect to.
 @discussion This method on IOS when triggered will open a native device selector allowing the user to select an external accessory to connect to. The accessory must adhere to one of the apps supported communication protocols defined in the application plist file.

 If the user cancels the device selector or selection of the device fails for any reason the application will call the failCallback.

 If the user selects a device that is still connected then the successCallback will be fired and the currently active accessory for the current application instance will be returned. It should be noted that on IOS via the device selector - user selection of a currently connected device is considered an error. Unfortunately Apple, in their wisdom, decided because of this that they wouldn't provide any information about the accessory that the user attempted to reconnect to. Because of this if the user does select an already connected device, the successCallback will be called and will contain either the currently connected app for the app instance, or a list of all connected items if no currently connected app exists.

 If the user selects a device that has not been connected and the user has defined a setDeviceDiscoveredListener then upon successful connection the device discovered listener will be fired and the accessory details will be returned via that method.
